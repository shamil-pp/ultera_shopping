I have used Riverpod for state management. It is my favourite solution and i felt it better than Provider and GetX. Due to riverpod's features such as data caching, .select (to selectively listening to items state - like used in product_list_page.dart) and accessing data of another provider inside a provider.. etc.

The UI is very minimal and built using AI since it was not a criteria, and i personally delegate such 'boilerplate' tasks to AI for better efficiency.
